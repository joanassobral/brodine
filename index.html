I want to say a couple things about it before I read it. I wanted to try to get at how I think when I’m working, so that’s a lot of what the piece is about: going in and out of how thoughts go in and out of my mind when my hands and mind are also involved in in work at the machine. Um, there’s one phrase in there where they’re calling me an electronic technician that I want to explain: I am a typesetter, and one particular union that I was trying to get in, um, had typesetters categorized as as people who are doing a certain kind of work and the boss, in order to keep me from getting into the union, simply called me another name. He called me an electronic technician, and um that’s somebody who fixes machines, and I don’t know how to do that.",intro_container)

I think too often we think of work as dreary and this and that but it’s it’s a tremendous source and place of resistance and humor. Lastly, there’s, this was written at the same time as Three Mile Island, so I really feel that it talks about what Meridel was speaking about, and um, and so there’s some dream material that works in there about radiation.",intro_container)
