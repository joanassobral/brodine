            <p class="essay_body_prg">The introduction of phototypesetting (a metonymic name for the larger process of photocomposition) brought with it major changes in the demographic composition of printing and pre-press labor. Management could either allow for the retraining of mostly white male linotype workers in new photocomposition jobs or else spring for new workers to be hired, often women who could be paid less and who, in many cases, already had facility with the QWERTY layout used for photographic composition (linotype keyboards had been laid out differently, did not afford touch-typing, and were understood to require sustained physical strength and the risk of burn injuries).<span class="essay_footnote">1</span> The QWERTY layout—that of a typewriter—was not an inevitable feature of phototypesetting design. As Cynthia Cockburn argues in her 1983 study of London male newspaper compositors, <i>Brothers: Male Dominance and Technological Change</i>: “the continued use of QWERTY has been to enable the integration of office and printing technologies and to enable the use of relatively cheap female typists on both” (Cockburn 1983: 99–100). In <i>Brothers</i>, a socialist-feminist study of masculinity at work, Cockburn focuses on the experiences of men who were “deskilled” by the transition to photocomposition.<span class="essay_footnote">2</span> The attitude that these men had toward typing labor was, Cockburn explains, deeply infused with feelings about feminized labor more generally and with what might be called the psychological wages of white masculinity.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">Cockburn explains that the transition to photocomposition was not only about increasing productivity; it was also about control and the breaking of workers’ political power (ibid: 91). The introduction of phototypesetting took place within a larger horizon of industrial transformation, and the direct input of copy (by writers and editors—bypassing typesetting as a profession altogether) was the writing on the wall. Few workers—and perhaps fewer managers—seem to have believed that photocomposition would be a permanent fixture of origination work. Computerized typesetting was a stopgap, and digitization was understood to be around the corner (Marshall 1983: 69–70). The feminization of typesetting, then, was part of a longer trajectory in its elimination as a form of steady wage work.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg  essay_body_prg_last">Due to union protections and negotiations, some linotype operators were retrained in computerized typesetting rather than laid off. In the United States, the International Typographical Union (ITU) also tended to approach the rise of phototypesetting and the threat it posed to workers’ power with a rearguard craft unionist strategy: the ITU leadership would be loyal to its “men” as “skilled” workers. National policy focused on negotiating contracts that guaranteed lifetime employment or early retirement for composition workers in exchange for allowing their existing jobs to be phased out by automation. This approach won out, on the whole, over efforts to unionize the women, queers, and people of color (including women and queers of color) who were increasingly finding employment at nonunion shops. Such people were soon to be employed as typesetters in new, open-shop typesetting businesses, and many pieced together work as freelancers. Perusal of ITU publications and mainstream media coverage from the period show this clearly, as do Brodine’s writings (think, for example, of my opening epigraph) as well as other literary texts more widely recognized to be central to the canon of LGBT literature. Leslie Feinberg’s path-breaking <i>Stone Butch Blues</i>, for example, includes in its closing pages a common historical narrative about Bertram Powers’ industrial strategy as president of ITU Local 6 in New York City:</p>

            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>I told him I’d stopped taking hormones and moved to New York City and now I was a typesetter.<br>
                    “Nonunion?” he asked.<br>
                    I nodded. “Yeah. When the computers came on the scene, the owners could see first how it was going to transform the old heat-lead industry. So they hired all the people the old craft union didn’t realize were important to organize. That’s how they broke the back of Local 6. (Feinberg 1993: 298)<span class="essay_footnote">3</span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">While Cockburn focuses on the experiences of men who were losing craft control of labor relations, Brodine’s poetry sets out from the position of already feminized and “deskilled” workers. This feminization of typesetting labor took place in an era when the waged workplace tacitly facilitated some expressions of same-sex desire following a brief retrenchment of employment opportunities for many women immediately after the Second World War.<span class="essay_footnote">4</span> The fact that phototypesetting could form an important basis for the development of queer print cultures was not a reflection of the technology itself; rather, this was in part because of the flexibility of the labor relations and management styles that the technology facilitated in a period of deindustrialization. There were more and less busy times of year, for example, enabling artists and activists to work intensely for a few months and then to take longer chunks of time off for artistic and political projects. Phototypesetting was somewhere between blue, white and pink-collar work—it was sometimes, although not always, done in an office environment, but was shift-work all the same, and it did not always require the consistent affective labor (or white femininity) of, for example, much corporate secretarial work.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">The “visibility” that some versions of lesbianism would achieve in the 1980s and 1990s, largely through the growth of the “professional managerial class” and of feminist and lesbian women’s inclusion in it, then, does not explain the working-class lesbian lives that are elaborated in the work of Brodine. Nor does phototypesetting work quite line up with what various theorists and historians have called the “gay economy,” or the “queer work,” of “camp labor,” insofar as phototypesetting did not necessarily mark one as queer.<span class="essay_footnote">5</span></p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">Phototypesetting and related jobs were, rather, attainable skillsets for people with good enough vision, typing know-how, and the capacity to learn new skills and adjust to technological changes.<span class="essay_footnote">6</span> This was appealing for many artists and writers who needed to make a living but who wanted to have flexible wage-work schedules. Of course, such flexibility was also often part and parcel of feminized jobs. As Brodine writes at the end of her long essay-poem “Money and Land”:</p>

            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>My mother always said, “A woman has to have some independent means of income, independent of marriage, I mean, Karen…”<br>
                    In the back of my mind, a practical little hand taps out, ‘she can type, she can type, and fast too.’ I count the jobs I’ve been somewhat paid for—berry-picker, baby-sitter, dance-teacher, writer, secretary, bread-baker, art model, waitress, house-cleaner, old woman’s companion, slide-mounter, writing teacher, dish-washer, paste-up person, typesetter, house-painter, inventory-taker, label-maker… And I have plans for a big garage sale. (Brodine 1980: 37–38)</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">Most of the jobs enumerated here were marked as feminized (many also involve heavy manual labor, including those that might be called “care” work). Most of these jobs required that a worker, either by choice or else by economic compulsion, would pick up work as and where possible without strong (or any) union protections. For Brodine, the fact that “she can type” provides an alternative to marriage (she herself had been married to a man in her early twenties), and it might allow her to scrape by. In this sense, flexible, feminized jobs could be linked to the prospect of combatting compulsory heterosexuality.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">Indeed, in her journals from November 1975, Brodine wrote, having secured a job in a typesetting shop:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>I think the job for me is an instant element of centeredness, sureness. Just to know I will have enough money for once in my life… I fantasize coming home that I come home to a woman, strong + a working person I come home + we are warm in a warm house + perhaps she has just walked in the door… Yet the truth is, I watch the moon leaning backwards in the sky right above my own little place. I live alone + cook for myself + after sleep alone. + now that is good… I don’t know how to live. But oh I want to be the strongest and happiest [and] perhaps finally I am learning this. (Brodine 1970–1987)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">It should not come as a surprise that the reality of a new job is linked, here, to Brodine’s capacity to thrive as a working-class lesbian. The fact that the job was in a non-union typesetting shop does not diminish this fact, even as Brodine cannot yet find a clear path to everything she desires. Still, with this job—and, implicitly, with her newfound involvement in political organizing—she feels she may be learning how happiness and strength are made.</p>
