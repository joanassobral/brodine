            <p class="essay_body_prg">This essay works through the poems of Marxist-feminist writer Karen Brodine in order to explain how LGBTQ+ people and other feminists in the US navigated late twentieth-century changes in print technology between 1965–1990, and to explore how this navigation shaped literary production in this period. During these years typesetting was computerized and then all but abandoned as part of the pre-print process. Karen Brodine was one of many working-class LGBTQ+ people, especially, but not only, lesbians and transmasculine workers, who found employment as typesetters in the 1970s and 1980s. While she is not the only writer whose work navigates the feminized and racialized class politics of new forms of printing labor, Brodine is singular in the extent to which the labor relations of typesetting are in full view at the surface of her writing. An excerpt from her 1981 poem, “Woman Sitting at the Machine, Thinking,” provides my epigraph. Even from this short excerpt, it is easy to see how this poem takes contested labor relations as sites for the development and elaboration of bodily capacities and skills, and not only of those that are a part of “work.” Brodine’s reference to the capillarization of fingers is not only clinically descriptive, it also evokes other possible uses of digital strength and dexterity and of blood letting, including those that might be more properly considered the domain of a pulp novel. Brodine accounts for the intertwining of intimacy and labor; her writing brings together the material production of literature with late twentieth-century working-class lesbian and queer life in the US.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">In the 1960s and 1970s, typesetting for large-run print jobs in the US underwent an unevenly distributed but rapid shift from “linotype” (a popular brand name for “line casting,” heavy machinery that casts hot metal “slugs”) to phototypesetting (basically two dimensional). This shift in pre-press technologies complemented the slightly earlier transition in large-scale printing from letterpress to photo-offset lithography. In each case, the technology shifted from three-dimensional impressions to two-dimensional, photographic processes for creating printing plates and for getting ink onto the final printing surface.<span class="essay_footnote">1</span> Phototypesetting technologies were constantly innovating during this period, and they involved the computerized storage of layout and copy data, whether in punched tape or microchips, to create film negatives that could be developed onto metal plates for printing.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">By the 1990s, typesetting as a distinct phase in the printing process was superseded by desktop and online publishing, while offset lithography remains to this day the go-to method for large-scale print runs of newspapers and books. The expansion of phototypesetting in the 1960s and 1970s had required that the mostly white and male linotype operators be retrained, or else that new workers be drafted in to take their place. These new workers were frequently women who could be paid less. Both the materials for and the relations of origination (pre-press) work were dramatically changed by this process, which involved the painful busting of old white-male-dominated trade unions and the opportunistic employment by industrial bosses of non-union workers previously excluded from these jobs. In other words: the politics of these new labor relations were deeply ambivalent.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">It was also in the wake of this transition that “lesbian and gay” literature came into prominence as a category among publishers, booksellers, printers, educators, and activists. This was the period in which the particular complex of text, labor, collectivity, and printed matter that we might call “LGBT literature” was quite literally composed. In this essay, I consider how gender and sexual categories, as well as queer forms of intimacy, were forged through the material relations of print-related wage work. Rather than claiming to “queer” these texts or this history, I would suggest that the category of “LGBT literature” came about in part through the feminized and racialized labor that still attends literary technologies.<span class="essay_footnote">2</span> I weave together three strands of argument: 1) a broad claim in the history of sexuality, that the growth of feminized labor in a previously masculine printing industry was part of the development of lesbian and proto-queer identities, collectivities, and structures of feeling; 2) a more tentative and implicit literary historical argument, that the shifting labor relations brought on by phototypesetting technologies contributed to the development of queer print cultures and of LGBT literature as a category; and 3) a more specific and definite argument about the work of Karen Brodine, which not only illustrates these developments but also provides a queer and Marxist-feminist politics that is responsive to the history of literary production.<span class="essay_footnote">3</span></p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">Karen Brodine’s writing has not received much critical attention, even as it has been important to a range of poets and activists and received substantive literary recognition during her lifetime.<span class="essay_footnote">4</span> One of my aims is to correct for the critical neglect of Brodine’s work by looking at some of her published poems and also by making reference to archival materials: personal journals, published political writings, and memos that she circulated in more limited fashion to her comrades as part of their organizing work. The most relevant critical treatment of Brodine for my purposes comes from Karen Kovacic, in an article titled “The Poetry of Pink Collar Resistance” that features nuanced readings of Karen Brodine’s work. Kovacic notes that in “Pink Collar” poetry, “secretaries and waitresses emphatically call attention to their presence as individuals and as members of a collective” (Kovacic 2001: 23). Her article proceeds to read Brodine’s work as counterpoising “the worker’s alienated and instrumental performance of her body on the job with her emotional and physical engagement during lovemaking” (ibid.: 23). Kovacic emphasizes the alienating aspects of Brodine’s work, although she also notes the fact that Brodine imagines a potentially revolutionary offshoot of pink-collar work. That is to say, Brodine works to show how women and other feminized workers might take control of the production and reproduction of the textual processes that are meant merely to pass through them. Kovacic’s is a precise and skillful reading of Brodine’s work, and it also bears extending. Indeed, Brodine’s descriptions of lesbian intimacy are not simply <i>opposed to</i> the “instrumental performance of her body on the job”; they are not <i>only</i> there as evidence of the alienating nature of word-processing labor. Rather, the labor relations that surround the typesetting computer are part and parcel of the revolutionary working-class and queer socialist-feminist politics that Brodine elaborates across her writing and that she worked for tirelessly in her life.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">Karen Brodine (1947–1987) was born in Seattle into a radical secular Jewish family (her maternal grandmother Harriet Pierce, who features in many of Brodine’s writings, was a member of the US Communist Party) and was raised in Woodinville, Washington. She moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in the mid-1960s to study dance at UC Berkeley, where she suffered a knee injury, at which point her creative efforts switched to poetry. In the mid-1970s, having studied for a Masters of Fine Arts in Writing at San Francisco State University, Brodine (along with her then girlfriend and fellow student Sukey Durham as well as writers Roz Spafford, Frances Phillips and others) co-founded the SFSU Women’s Caucus. The Caucus, which would later come to be known as the Women Writers Union (WWU) was originally formed in an effort change the structure of the English Masters oral exams so that they might include women and non-white writers (“Creative Writers Seek New Degree Policy”). Through her work with the WWU, Brodine, along with Nellie Wong, Merle Woo, and others, came to join Durham as members of Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party, two affiliated socialist-feminist organizations in the Trotskyist tradition; these women launched the Bay area branches of these organizations.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">Brodine also helped to found the Berkeley Poets Cooperative and Kelsey St. Press, which respectively published her first two books of poetry, <i>Slow Juggling</i> (1975) and <i>Work Week</i> (1977). Her third book, <i>Illegal Assembly</i> (1980) was published by the New York-based Hanging Loose press, and her final book, <i>Woman Sitting at the Machine, Thinking</i> (1990), was published posthumously by the Freedom Socialist Party’s (FSP) affiliate, Red Letter Press, after a number of feminist presses had rejected the manuscript (Brodine 1986: 4). It is perhaps no surprise that Red Letter Press embraced the book, in light not only of the politics of the work itself but also of the extent to which Brodine had focused her energies on organizing with FSP and Radical Women. She took on many leadership roles, including as organizer of the San Francisco branch of Radical Women and of FSP. She also did extensive work on a variety of defensive campaigns as the organizations’ communist radicalism came under legal attacks.<span class="essay_footnote">5</span> Brodine also did the publishing, book design, typesetting, and wrote the introduction for Gloria Martin’s <i>Socialist Feminism: The First Decade 1966–1976</i>, the first book to be published by Red Letter Press.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">The rejection of her more militant Marxist arguments by some cultural feminists fed into a wider theme throughout Brodine’s work: the multiple sources of silencing and censorship that she faced. She was acutely aware of the ways in which her writing was prevented from reaching potential readers, and she experienced her terminal illness as continuous with these forces of silencing and repression. Brodine died in 1987 from advanced breast cancer that had gone undiagnosed as a result of medical negligence (her journals and her poetry testify to feelings of serious illness years prior to her diagnosis).<span class="essay_footnote">6</span> Her personal papers, and some of her published works, indicate an awareness of the limited audiences for which she wrote. She resented the ways in which her writing was deemed irrelevant or uninteresting by some other feminists because it was writing by a working class Marxist lesbian. Censorship in these many modes is a central problem for Brodine’s poetry. At the same time, her poetry teases out ways in which capitalist literary technologies, in the moment of their feminization, might be expropriated, shared, and liberated against censorship. This complex intertwining of literary labor, technology, and lesbian existence is as thoroughly imagined in Brodine’s work as it is anywhere else.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last" >In what follows, I begin by providing a more detailed account of the feminization of typesetting in the period after 1965; I read Brodine’s work to see how, in her account, this feminization conditioned some late twentieth-century forms of queer life. I then take a detour through other queer and feminist responses to technological shifts in printing labor, in order to outline some of alternative practices of LGBTQ+ literary production in this period. Finally, I synthesize these various strands in an extended reading of the “thinking” that Brodine’s work takes as its subject. Her dialectical approach to poetics can model how we engage the history and politics of queer literary production.</p>

                            "I use the terms “feminized” and “racialized” labor in the sense of work that is marked by the politically distorted sense of the value of the labor power of the workers who do it. Conversely, “feminized” work tends to further feminize those who do it. In this, I follow Rosemary Hennessy’s account of feminized “second skins” (Hennessy 2013: 171).",
                            "I understand these claims to be in conversation with recent work in queer Marxism, particularly the work of Rosemary Hennessy and Holly Lewis on feminization, labor, and non-normative sexual practices. See Hennessy 2013, Lewis 2016, and also Floyd 2009, Liu 2015, Tinkcom 2002, and the yet-unpublished work of Nat Raha on queer labor and trans social reproduction. For recent accounts of the gay left and of gays and lesbians in the labor movement, respectively, see Hobson 2016 and Frank 2014.",

                            "It is possible that some of the chemical processing involved in photocomposition may have contributed to Brodine’s cancer. Many of her journal entries contain retrospectively upsetting notes along the lines of one typed entry dated “July 30” and likely from 1979 or 1980: “I’m afraid of how my chest hurts. It must be the fumes. Nothing else could make it feel this way.” (Brodine 1970–1987: np) See Boyer 2015 also for an extended consideration of sickness and labor in relation to Brodine’s poem."]
