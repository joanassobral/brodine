            </div>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">Brodine wrote the above words in the same journal in which she composed many of the poems that would appear in her second book, <i>Work Week</i> (1977). Indeed, Brodine’s work as a typesetter, and the kinds of organizing she did in relation to her job, coincided with her development as a gay woman, a communist, and a poet. Brodine was employed at the time by the magazine Communication Arts, Inc., where she was part of an ultimately successful effort to unionize those who worked in typesetting and related pre-press work. But this effort doesn’t really show up until the later <i>Illegal Assembly</i> (1980); <i>Work Week</i>, for its part, foregrounds in a primarily descriptive mode the relations between feminized labor and the critique of political economy. The book is framed by a cover featuring the calculation of clients and jobs, including a range of different origination tasks from typesetting to paste-up to offset plate preparation (“opaquing and dyeing”). The book is named for one of the mechanisms by which the capital–labor relation subsumes the worker’s life. The title suggests that all aspects of life are structured by the calculation of labor time, including the writing of “poetry” and the sharing of private intimacy.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">Alongside this reduction of duration to the calculation of labor time, <i>Work Week</i> investigates the relations among women in feminized workplaces that require or encourage feminine self-presentation. The book’s third poem, for example, is titled “The receptionist is by definition” and closes as follows:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>2. the receptionist is by definition underpaid to lie<br><br>
                    remember the receptionist with the lovely<br>
                    smile, with the green eyes, the cropped<br>
                    hair, big feet, small knees, with the <br>
                    wrinkled hands, the large breasts, with<br>
                    the husky voice, the strong chin?<br>
                        She takes her breaks<br>
                    In the washroom, grimacing, waving her fists<br>
                    At the blurred reflection of her dress. <br>
					(Brodine 1977: 11)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">This receptionist is marked by stereotypical feminine descriptors (“the lovely/ smile”) but the poem pushes past this, presenting a much more detailed physical description, followed by the acknowledgement of her time <i>off</i> the clock: time that is stolen away from capital’s demands for feminized self-presentation. The description points to the tacit forms of attention that women pay each other, and the book as a whole features tentative relationships between women that might be described as part of what Adrienne Rich called the “lesbian continuum” (Rich 1980). The first section of <i>Work Week</i>, “On the Job,” opens with an untitled poem that reads in its entirety:</p>
            
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>new to this office, we watch <br>
                    the faces of the other women<br>
                    for clues, to discover which tribe,<br>
                    we watch their soft faces<br>
                    for the quick glance, the laugh<br>
                    of recognition, what we call<br>
                    the understanding<br>
                    (ibid.: 9)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">In this office, women work together for low wages and communicate through coded looks and silences. <i>Work Week</i> presents itself, as well as the dreams that it narrates, as an alternative or escape. The possibility of relationships between women at work is presented as a puzzle or challenge, as in the following excerpt from the opening of “Jigsaw Riddle”:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>who’s that woman avalanching down the street? <br><br>
                    setting the margins<br>
                    doesn’t justify, but<br>
                    I can frame her face                   <span class="spacing_for_poem">the word</span><br>
                    with my hands, what<br>
                    we both dreamt, a jig-                      <span class="spacing_for_poem">floats down through</span><br>
                    saw puzzle of planes,<br>
                    welded cold steel                                     <span class="spacing_for_poem">the memory</span><br>
                    in a sky that would<br>
                    not rain<br>
						(ibid.: 22)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">Women’s faces are sources of fascination here, and they are framed by the timeline of the workweek (as in the case of the receptionist) and by the restrictions of the typeset page. But “setting the margins” and justifying the lines can’t frame this relationship in the same way that <i>hands</i> would. Indeed, the column on the left-hand side of the page is typographically disrupted by the skillfully set (by Brodine) “floating” words to the right. In <i>Work Week</i>, wage labor is a barrier, and women try to breach it with imagined and furtive connections—glances, words, and touches—but it remains a sort of limiting partition. Not all of the poems confine themselves to silence and non-communication—there are moments of overt conversation between women, but many of these seem to be reported dreams.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">By the time of <i>Illegal Assembly</i> (Hanging Loose Press, 1980) and especially <i>Woman Sitting at the Machine, Thinking</i> (Red Letter Press, 1990) Brodine had developed new ways of thinking about feminist political agency in the workplace—through, on the one hand, acts of sabotage, and on the other hand, the collective development of political skill and power. If <i>Work Week</i> primarily engaged with typesetting labor in terms of the silences imposed by technology and management, it was in <i>Illegal Assembly</i> that Brodine moved toward actively building collective power in the context of the feminized workplace. The book is less obviously about work than it is about forms of collectivity and the changes that both legal and illegal assemblies can bring about. “Making the Difference,” for example, discusses the process of organizing a union (presumably at Communication Arts, Inc.): “in two weeks we will have a union election. we will vote yes and no. we will win or lose. it will make a difference” (Brodine 1980: 50). Brodine has developed confidence in her <i>political</i> and her technical skills, and she explores the pleasures that come from acquiring and playing with new skills: “when I learn something new at work, even when it is very minor, and could in time become drudgery, the hours shrink. / I like the clean slice of the exacto blade against the drawing board.” (ibid.: 56). Here, skill is presented as a source of pleasure and as an aspiration—it is a generative part of being with others. This entails a rejection of the rhetoric of “deskilling” that accompanies the encroachment of feminized labor and that amounts to a political assault on feminized versions of skill: “I have skills and they attach to what I need   or love / there are skills I don’t have and I mean to learn them” (ibid.: 61).<span class="essay_footnote">1</span> These lines appear in <i>Illegal Assembly</i>, and they were taken directly from Brodine’s June 29, 1977 journal entry. In the journal, they are preceded by an indication of the political nature of Brodine’s thinking about skill as a typesetter, a writer, and an organizer: “Skill is a hand-up toward power when it is applied toward our (+ I mean the group’s) own ends.” (Brodine 1970–1987: np)</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">Simultaneously, <i>Illegal Assembly</i> begins to reflect in detail the extent to which these skills can turn the worker into a sort of word-processing machine:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>at work I have to let the brutality of language turned against us flow thru my hands—typing, “a relatively senseless robot will be marketed under the name, ‘the Helen Keller robot.’” (Brodine 1980: 55)<span class="essay_footnote">2</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">Similar sharp reportage of management discourse shows up in the tongue-in-cheek lunch-break discussions that run throughout “Opposites That Bleed One Into the Other or Collide”:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>at lunch I sit with other office workers sunning on a small scrap<br>
                    of sidewalk<br>
                    it’s so nice to work in the arts<br>
                    it’s so laid-back we don’t have to dress up<br>
                    & they don’t even mind gays working here<br>
                    her supervisor said she was only half a woman<br>
                    (ibid: 53–54)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">As its title implies, this poem is typographically rendered as a picture of dialectics. Right and left aligned portions of text are “opposed” on the page but also show themselves to be the flip sides of each other through their alternations down the page. The typographically opposed portions of this text are no longer quite divided up into reality and dream, as they were in <i>Work Week</i>; they are instead processes of change and movement through antagonism and opposition. The final section of the poem documents the materials for revolutionary assembly that have been built by the concentration of feminized office work in the deindustrialized core of San Francisco, and it moves from left-to-right-to-center aligned text:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>and leaning out the window, I watch the small fist of a three-month strike<br>
                    up the street flowering into bright turning signs and shouting people, circling, circling<br><br>
                    
                    and staring up the street I see hundreds of green streetcars stopped now backed<br>
                    up stockstill unbudging for blocks.   <span class="spacing_for_poem">a disruption in service.</span>   <span class="spacing_for_poem">a stoppage.</span><br><br>
                    
                    and people rushing and tumbling out of the cars like water—<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="spacing_for_poem">we could shut this city down.</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">The last line is centered, as is, in a sense, the book as a whole. This growth of Brodine’s confidence and transformative vision is not only a result of the passage of time, or of simply having written or worked more. It is clear from her journals that coming out as a lesbian, and doing so in the context of organizing with the Women Writers Union, Radical Women, and the Freedom Socialist Party, changed her day-to-day understanding of her life. Each of these organizations prioritized the training of women, queer people, and people of color for revolutionary political leadership. This experience of leadership—and of using and developing her skills, including those that she learned at work, for political purposes—may explain Brodine’s facility in writing about alternative, humane ways of organizing the activity of making and distributing printed texts and other forms of information.</p>
