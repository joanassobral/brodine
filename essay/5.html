            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">Following on this exploration of some alternative forms of queer literary labor, I close with an extended reading of Brodine’s “Woman Sitting at the Machine, Thinking,” the title poem from the 1990 book of the same name. The poem was originally written in 1981, and it is the most sustained of Brodine’s poems that engage with phototypesetting labor. If Work Week indicated the ways in which feminized wage labor might facilitate tacit expressions of lesbian desire, and <i>Illegal Assembly</i> began to theorize the revolutionary potential of feminized workers, “Woman Sitting” returns to these problems, mediated this time by a dialectical approach to the material conditions of its own writing. In my reading, I track “thinking” as an abstraction that Brodine’s materialist poetics renders concrete: this thinking is conditioned by and responsive to the social conditions of feminized, queer literary labor. Thinking is not a collective escape from but is rather a <i>communist elaboration of</i> feminized labor.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">Brodine wrote this poem while she was working for Howard Quinn Co., a unionized, family run all-service print shop, as a typesetter. Brodine herself was initially kept out of the union on the basis that she was an “electronic technician” rather than a writer; she contested this and eventually won membership in GAIU Local 280, only to be placed into a partitioned room, separated from the other non-union phototypesetters (Brodine c. 1981: 2). The poem moves through the everyday work experiences of a typesetter in a small shop, and it weaves into the description of these routines bits of dreams, memories, and fantasies: about animals, about other women, about spontaneous insurrection, and about organized revolutions.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">The poem's composition tracks “thinking” across the processes that comprise the daily routines and expropriations of photocomposition. This includes the selection and placement of characters, the justification of lines, and the manipulation of codes to call up and store different jobs:</p>

                                            (Brodine 1990: 5)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">Kathleen Fraser writes of this passage that “as Brodine keeps a mental tally of her mechanical tasks, she simultaneously notes the deep silence soaking up her fellow workers and pulling her into mental drift” (Fraser 1991: 24).<span class="essay_footnote">1</span> I would add to Fraser’s account that, in spite or because of so much silence, the poem presents its own activities, including the thinking that it weaves through the computer, as sites of struggle: the thinking is not simply a product of the machine, but it is conditioned by it all the same. Thinking emerges alongside the peculiar collective social experience of phototypesetting, and it describes an unvoiced choreography, a kind of silent communication around the machines.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">In the lines that follow, a different kind of thinking—and of communication—is slotted in among the codes:</p>

                    then floating free, the delicate fabric of motion and touch<br>
                    knit with listening and humming and soaring.<br>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">Thoughts “sneak through,” here—the silent room is filled with the memories of a different arrangement of bodies and modes of speaking and thinking together. As in <i>Work Week</i> and <i>Illegal Assembly</i>, however, the poem demonstrates that “women’s work” and “lesbian love” are not simply opposed bodily experiences. Indeed, there is a sort of “speaking together from body” in the typesetters’ subaltern modes of communication with regard to their racist and sexist bosses:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>because they must think we are stupid in order <br>

                    knowing “something’s going on,” peering like moles.<br>
                    how can they know the quirk of an eyebrow behind their back?<br>
                    they suspect we hate them because they know<br>
                    what they are doing to us—but we are only <br>
                    stupid Blacks or crazy Puerto Ricans, or dumb blonds.<br><br>

                    they need us too much, with their talk of <br>

                    we carry them, loads of heavy, dull metal,<br>
                    outmoded and dusty.<br>
                    they try to control us, building partitions,<br>
                    and taking the faces off the phones.<br>
                    they talk to us slow and loud,<br>
                    HOW ARE YOU TODAY? HERE’S A CHECK FOR YOU.<br>
                    As if it were a gift.<br><br>
                     
                    we say—even if they stretched tape<br>
                    across our mouths<br>
                    we could still speak to one another <br>
                    with our eyebrows<br>
                                            (Brodine 1990: 7–8)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">While the regular exchange of raised eyebrows is not identical to “lovemaking last night,” both involve the building of coordinated skills and perhaps of political power in the face of a generalized disregard for the embodied lives of working-class women. The speaking through eyebrows is, of course, not any kind of guarantee of solidarity among the feminized workers—and, certain versions of female solidarity at work are premised on the expulsion of gender nonconforming people.<span class="essay_footnote">2</span> All the same, the knowledge conveyed in these exchanges, that “we carry them, loads of heavy, dull metal, / outmoded and dusty” is a small advantage that the typesetters have over management. Management is figured here as the heavy metal linotype machines whose white male operators were prioritized by labor leadership over the women and queer people increasingly finding work in the industry. Management is also figured as having a disadvantage in terms of both technical and political skill. Brodine has learnt that there is some power on the flipside of her downgraded status. The conditions of her work allow for the generation of skills, and these are skills that must be taken into the hands of those who have been silently collectivized.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">Again, this dialectic between technical deskilling and political power is rendered through the movement of “thinking” across the poem. The woman who is “thinking” is not simply shaped by lovemaking and wage labor: she is shaped by the Marxist-feminist praxis that Brodine developed with comrades in the Women Writers Union, Freedom Socialist Party, and Radical Women. Brodine described the genesis of the project in a 1984 letter to her good friend, gay Filipino writer, Edgar Poma: “Do you know what inspired that poem? (I mean besides the job I was working at then). A talk on Marxist economics by [an FSP comrade]. It was that talk that spoke of human labor hours stored up in machines, and so on, and really got me thinking” (Brodine 1984: np). This explanation of machinery by way of Marx’s labor theory of value also inflects the significance of the word "thinking": it appears not quite to belong to the woman in the title: "Woman Sitting at the Machine, Thinking.” “Thinking” posits a dimension of freedom from work, but it is a freedom conditioned by the choreographic constraints of typesetting labor: code, rhythm, gesture, posture, manipulation of text as seen on the monitor or video display terminal, and transfer of data to the mainframe. The placement of “thinking” after the comma affords some ambiguity about the agent of the thinking: woman, machine, or woman-machine. That is, “thinking” is <i>conditioned by</i> rather than simply <i>outside of or beyond</i> the relations of feminized wage labor.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">Take the opening lines of “Woman Sitting at the Machine, Thinking”:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>she thinks about everything at once without making a mistake.<br>
                    no one has figured out how to keep her from doing this thinking<br>
                    while her hands and nerves also perform every delicate complex <br>
                    function of the work. this is not automatic or deadening.<br>
                    try it sometime. make your hands move quickly on the keys<br>
                    fast as you can, while you are thinking about:<br><br>
                    
                    the layers, fossils. the idea that this machine she controls<br>
                    is simply layers of human workhours frozen in steel, tangled <br>
                    in tiny circuits, blinking out through lights like hot, red eyes…<br>
                                                    (Brodine 1990: 3)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">“Thinking” is something that emerges through the material discipline of work, alongside the silences and solidarities that accompany it. Brodine grasps at the hierarchical and networked relations and forces that determine her life, and she delineates the contradictions that underpin and threaten this ordering of relations. Thinking happens in spite of apparent attempts to prevent it from taking place (“no one has figured out how to keep her from doing this thinking”) and especially to <i>prevent it from being shared</i>.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">At the same time, at least some of this thinking also enters <i>into</i> the machine and is thereby destined for expropriation by the bosses; it does not simply escape the relations of production. The mainframe computer and the information that it stores are the private property of the bosses and of their clients. This is the literal transfer of feminized human labor power (quantified “thinking”) to an expropriating machine. In this sense, the poem literalizes the fact that capitalism recuperates and appropriates feminized interventions in technique:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>we sell ourselves in fractions. they don't want us all<br>
                    at once, but hour by hour, piece by piece. our hands mainly<br>
                    and our backs. and chunks of our brains. and veiled expressions<br>
                    on our faces, they buy. though they can't know what actual <br>

            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">These “actual / thoughts… behind our eyes” are cold comfort if the means for their communication and preservation are not “ours.” And writing and reading poetry—sharing these thoughts—cannot resolve this problem.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">That is, while the poem comprehends at once the machine, the feminized work, and the thinking that stream into it as social material, it also expresses a wish that the computer <i>could</i> hold and convey all of the thinking that takes place in front of it. Brodine writes a demand for the machine and a wish to store meaning and labor in the machine in a way that is <i>not</i> an expropriation:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>what if you could send anything in and call it out again?<br>

                    search for tiger, execute<br>
                    the words stream up the screen till tiger trips the halt<br>
                    search for seal   search for strike<br>
                    search for the names of women<br><br>
                    
                    we could circle our words around the world<br>
                    like dolphins streaking through water their radar<br>
                    if the screens were really in the hands of experts: us.<br>
                    think of it–our ideas whipping through the air<br>
                    everything stored in an eyeflash<br>
                    our whole history, ready and waiting. <br>
                    (Brodine 1990: 17)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">Here, the machine becomes an enabling condition of joy and desire precisely because of all it has absorbed of collective feminized labor, of unspoken conversations, of women rolling their eyes at management and glaring into the machine, and of women looking longingly at one another over the machines. The contradictory labor relations of computerized typesetting, and the social antagonisms that these relations entail, make up Brodine’s vision of feminized labor (and of thinking) as concrete activity. The poem calls for efforts to make it so—to appropriate the machine so that “our whole history, ready and waiting” can be readily available to “experts: us.”</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">For this to be possible, the woman at the machine has to engage in various forms of resistance, including, but not limited to, collective industrial action. Brodine did just this, as I have already noted. But the context of Brodine’s work—the relatively brief historical window during which typesetting was simultaneously feminized and computerized—potentiated other, complementary but distinct forms of organizing and resistance. Stealing time or just using machines after hours to typeset poems about feminized labor certainly falls into this category of resistance. A single typewritten sheet of paper archived among Brodine’s teaching materials is titled “Sabotage.” The page seems to be Brodine’s notes for a public reading or performance. She has typed:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>writing about work is a form of sabotage.<br><br>

                    ………………………………<br><br>
                    
                    sneaking words into the memory of the machine…<br>
                                            (Brodine c. 1980.: np)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">Brodine, unlike some of the “Language” poets who were her San Francisco contemporaries, did not expect formal linguistic experimentation on its own to resolve or even intervene directly in the contradictions of capitalist society.<span class="essay_footnote">3</span> Rather, she saw poetry learning from and being shaped by collective struggles against capitalism as a total system, struggles coordinated and led by those whose labor has most often been undervalued because it is racialized and feminized. As she wrote in a controversial essay on “The Politics of Women Writing”:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>The poem I write, <i>by itself</i>, will not organize for affirmative action, or abortion. Action, organizing with other people, has to do that. New different poems come out of that organizing experience. I can give a new poem, copied secretly on the office machine, to my fellow workers. Because the images in it come from us, our anger, our resistance, my co-workers care for the poem, and it become[s] a part of the gathering force of our solidarity. For that poem can collect on one page a record of the contradictions we experience every day. I have yet to know the use of a poem the way I know the use of a hammer. Yet I feel a poem is surely a tool. (Brodine 1979: 9)<span class="essay_footnote">4</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">The arguments that Brodine makes here for the “use” of poetry are not about the creation of revolutionary forms of subjectivity in an abstract reader. Rather, poems are materially situated in the production and distribution of literary language, and Brodine sees “the poem” as a technology that affords particular uses. The poem, “Woman Sitting at the Machine, Thinking” has a range of such possible uses, one of which is to share it with her coworkers as part of the collective development of political skill.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">Brodine’s “sabotage” is not (or is at least not only) intended to ironize the labor relations that condition it, to make irreverent fun out of her work for sharing with professional writers who are not her comrades. This is not to say that the poems are not fun and funny (they are), and that others wouldn’t want to read them (many do), but rather that they are geared toward the collective transformation of queer literary labor. This is not simply a matter of Brodine’s moral decision making or of some special individual attitude that she held toward poetry—rather, it has everything to do with the objective, feminized labor relations of typesetting work in this period. And it also has to do with Brodine’s political orientation, as a leading member in socialist-feminist organizations, toward a revolutionary strategy that takes as its basic condition of possibility the feminization and racialization of the US working class. Thinking and writing can be individually engaged activities, but when they are also part of the conditions of labor, they can line up with ways of feeding collective disruption into the management machine, and of enlisting technologies (screens, memory, and even deadly chemical processes) to aid in this resistance. </p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">Such resistance, it must be added, was framed by the fact that pre-press and printing labor would be further outsourced in the years to follow through the explosion of logistics and the outsourcing of much microchip fabrication and computer manufacturing, a story that might profitably be explored in relation to the global feminization of literary and printing labor all the way down the supply chain. By contrast, in Brodine’s work, the machine comprises both the terminal and the mainframe—the machine and the information that it stored were on site, and the point of production was relatively centralized. That this particular combination of access to the means of print production and Marxist-feminist praxis under discussion in this article was localized and relatively brief does not, however, limit its purchase for thinking about and engaging in the concrete activities that are abstractly called “LGBT literature” today. In a journal entry from October 7, 1983, Brodine wrote out a plan to perform “the working poem” at a reading and to introduce it according to these indications:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>Explain: from one shop—wouldn’t let in union—call by another name. found poem—word stretches out. Thinking in and out of the gaps of the work itself… The poem in the form that material <i>goes</i> into the machine. //files//… resistance the prime ingredient. (Brodine 1970–1987: np)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">Brodine’s work shows us that this kind of queer poetic resistance—getting it into the machine—was made distinctly possible, for a relatively brief time, by the feminization of typesetting labor in the United States.</p>

                            "Indeed, in Feinberg’s Stone Butch Blues, Jess is subjected at a typesetting shop to painful transphobic suspicions by cisgendered women coworkers, who, while conferring with each other in a manner reminiscent of the raised eyebrows in Brodine’s poem, identify Jess as “a psycho,” “effeminate,” “gay,” and “the kind you gotta watch out for” (Feinberg 1993: 265). Jess leaves work and never returns to that particular shop.",
                            "See “Response to L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E,” in Illegal Assembly. Brodine writes: “I say blow the house down / the whole house, not just the words” and later “it’s true I want things to mean / it’s true I mean things/ to change…” (Brodine 1980: 51–52). ",
                            "This article caused significant controversy among the radical feminist readership of the feminist journal Second Wave, not least for Brodine’s blunt criticisms of Adrienne Rich and of radical feminism more broadly. Brodine’s comrades wrote letters-to-the-editor in defense of Brodine in subsequent issues, as did science fiction writer Joanna Russ. Rich, for her part, wrote movingly about Brodine’s work on numerous occasions (e.g., Rich 1991)."]
