            <p class="essay_body_prg">Brodine’s poetry, of course, was not the only development in LGBTQ+ literary production that was enabled by the era of photocomposition. I will shortly turn to Brodine’s landmark poem, “Woman Sitting at the Machine, Thinking,” but first I take a detour through some of the other queer consequences of new printing technologies, specifically the development of new typesetting, printing, and publishing collectives. I do so to locate the specificity of Brodine’s queer and Marxist-feminist poetic project in a broader context of queer and feminist literary production: Brodine’s first two books had, after all, been published respectively by the Berkeley Poets Cooperative and Kelsey St. Press (she had helped to found and did voluntary origination and publishing work for each).<span class="essay_footnote">1</span> Kelsey St. had their early titles printed at the West Coast Print Center, a community endeavor that donated typesetting and printing equipment to small presses, especially within avant-garde poetry circles. Collectives of this sort, including a range of alternative and underground presses and other feminist and gay liberation publishing ventures, were widespread, if often short-lived, during this period.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">A rich body of work on feminist and LGBT print culture (scholarly and otherwise) has shown that for LGBTQ+ publishers—including those committed to feminist and gay liberation politics—there was a pervasive tension between ambitions for political autonomy, on the one hand, and the instability of the printing and publishing industries that undergirded them on the other.<span class="essay_footnote">2</span> For publishers, access to affordable computerized typesetting and small offset litho did indeed allow for large-run prints of materials that might otherwise have been censored or else produced by necessity using more limited duplicating machines. This advantage is noted repeatedly in reflections by gay and lesbian publishers, such as Gay Sunshine Press’s Winston Leyland, who reports that the printer for John Wiener’s pioneering <i>Hotel Wentley Poems</i> “was so uptight that he deliberately left out the word ‘cock’ in ‘Cocksuckers,’ and a second printing with the unexpurgated title had to be done almost immediately” (Leyland 1975: 8).</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">But if access to phototypesetting and offset printing allowed for greater control over content, it also brought up the more complicated but equally critical question of control over the means of production of printing. While phototypesetting equipment was within reach for some LGBTQ+ and feminist presses and typesetting collectives, large-scale offset printing machinery was usually out of reach. Autonomous publishing collectives still needed to manage print production. This presented distinct challenges for feminist, lesbian, and gay publishing and printing ventures that sought to maintain nonhierarchical and collective decision making and production processes, as it did for the “underground press” more broadly.<span class="essay_footnote">3</span></p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">For some print collectives, and particularly for lesbian-feminist groups, the key challenge was in maintaining both autonomy <i>and</i> non-hierarchical relationships, and this involved skill-sharing and job rotation. In some cases, autonomy and equality were understood to be mutually reinforcing.<span class="essay_footnote">4</span> Barbara Smith, a trailblazing black feminist and supporter of Brodine, Merle Woo, and Nellie Wong, located her impetus for co-founding Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press in autonomy and control, referring to “our need for autonomy, our need to determine independently both the content and conditions of our work” (Smith, 2014 [1989]: 155). But Smith also reflected on the political difficulties of managing such a project <i>as a business</i>.<span class="essay_footnote">5</span> Running presses autonomously and collectively did not guarantee their survival, if survival was dependent on profitability, which it was for many presses and publishers such as Kitchen Table that did not have wealthy patrons or people able or willing to live without steady wages.<span class="essay_footnote">6</span> While, on the one hand, the expansion of photo-offset printing and of queer and feminist typesetting collectives helped more people to produce and distribute on a large scale, these technological developments also accelerated the organizational and political problems of functioning as businesses. When asked by Matt Richardson if Kitchen Table was a collective, Smith remarked, “That was what was said on the piece of paper… We had a commitment to people having non-hierarchical roles and relationships, but it can be very difficult, particularly if you are running what is essentially a business, to operate in that way” (Smith, 2014: 157).</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">Charley Shively, a central member of the staff of the Boston-based anarchist periodical <i>Fag Rag</i>, recalled how changes in typesetting technology affected the labor relations of the collective. This was the case, for example, when they started having to pay for typesetting:</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>
            <div class="essay_quotation">
                <p>Seeing the need for typesetting in the gay community, [David Stryker] started a part-time business. Ken Sanchez, who worked for Stryker, was able to type out <i>Fag Rag</i> text (with some volunteer help) after hours; we paid a dollar an hour for using the machine… Stryker charged basically at cost per issue; still our typesetting costs quadrupled. He saw it as a sacrifice for the movement; others saw it as an inroad of capitalism. (Wachsberger, 2012: np)</p>

            <div class="essay_spacer"></div>

            <p class="essay_body_prg">Shively’s account, while detailed, is hardly exceptional. Cheap print and typesetting machinery was not always readily available through community print centers and personal contacts, and most radical and underground collectives had little starting capital with which to pay for origination and printing. While new typesetting technologies could allow for more efficient and sophisticated control over typesetting, Shively notes that constant shifts in technology also made ideals of autonomy and collectivity more difficult to attain than they otherwise might have been. The expertise required for operating the machinery as it continually developed posed challenges to the collective’s anti-capitalist and nonhierarchical aspirations. Moreover, as Shively notes, by the end of the 1980s, “Desktop publishing almost instantly wiped away all the skills learned on the Compugraphic.”</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg">In other words, the use of new typesetting technologies (including piecemeal methods of origination, e.g. laying-out and photographing typewriter copy) in radical egalitarian collectives can only be understood as an uneasy development in the face of the feminization and racial-ethnic diversification of the typographical labor force. That is, such collective efforts, and particularly LGBTQ+ and feminist businesses that depended on making ends meet (if not on making profits), were the flipside of the feminization and casualization of much printing labor in the de-industrializing global North, and they stood on shaky ground.</p>
            <p class="essay_body_prg essay_body_prg_last">Brodine’s work pushes past this tension between the ideal of autonomy and the need for profit. Unlike some separatist and cultural feminists, Brodine never wanted to abandon the feminized waged workplace as a site for feminist struggle, even as she certainly did not idealize such wage work or see it as liberating in itself. Brodine’s poetry centers feminized labor—including waged literary labor—as a site of <i>struggle and elaboration</i> rather than something to be abandoned in favor of separatist or nonhierarchical ideals. Through her writing, Brodine showed that all work, but particularly undervalued and feminized work, was as suitable a topic for feminist poetry as was anything else; she raged at the economic and racial privileges of those feminist writers who argued that the workplace was a masculine domain from which women should remove themselves. She refused feminist dismissals of wage labor, that is, and wanted instead to think about feminized work in the context of an ever-changing social totality.</p>
